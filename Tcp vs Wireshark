# 🛰️ tcpdump vs Wireshark — Pentester Cheat Sheet

A clean comparison of tcpdump and Wireshark for cybersecurity, pentesting, and networking.

## 🔵 tcpdump
**Command-line packet capture tool.**

### What tcpdump does:
- Captures network packets in real time
- Displays packets as text in the terminal
- Saves packet captures to `.pcap` files
- Uses fast, powerful capture filters (BPF)
- Perfect for remote servers and VPN interfaces (tun0)

### When tcpdump is best:
- SSH sessions  
- HackTheBox / TryHackMe VPN traffic  
- Remote Linux servers  
- Lightweight real-time capture  
- Quick debugging  
- Environments where GUI is not available

### Strengths:
- ✔️ Fast
- ✔️ Lightweight
- ✔️ CLI-based
- ✔️ Ideal for servers & cloud
- ✔️ Great for capturing traffic to analyze later in Wireshark

### Weaknesses:
- ❌ No GUI
- ❌ Harder to visualize streams
- ❌ Not beginner-friendly for deep analysis

## 🟣 Wireshark
**GUI packet analysis tool.**

### What Wireshark does:
- Captures AND analyzes packets
- GUI with color coding and protocol dissection
- Deep packet inspection (TCP, TLS, DNS, etc.)
- Reassembles streams (HTTP pages, TCP sessions)
- Visual flow diagrams and readable breakdowns

### When Wireshark is best:
- Full packet analysis  
- Malware/traffic research  
- Visualizing connections and sessions  
- Debugging authentication flows  
- Viewing decrypted traffic (with keys)

### Strengths:
- ✔️ Visual and beginner-friendly  
- ✔️ Beautiful color-coded packets  
- ✔️ Deep protocol analysis  
- ✔️ Easy filtering and breakdown  
- ✔️ Reconstructs TCP streams

### Weaknesses:
- ❌ Heavy on resources  
- ❌ Not ideal over SSH  
- ❌ Not great for remote servers  
- ❌ Too slow for massive captures

## 🔥 Quick Comparison Table

| Feature | tcpdump | Wireshark |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Interface | CLI | GUI |
| Best for | Capturing | Analyzing |
| Speed | Fast | Slower |
| Detail | Medium | Extremely detailed |
| Use on remote server | ✔️ Yes | ❌ No |
| Use on HTB tun0 | ✔️ Yes | ✔️ Yes |
| Saves .pcap files | ✔️ Yes | ✔️ Yes |
| Filtering | BPF (powerful) | Display filters (powerful) |

## 🎯 ONE-LINE SUMMARY
**tcpdump = capture traffic.  
Wireshark = analyze traffic.**
